# üß∞ ToolServer

ToolServer is the server that provides XAgent with powerful and safe tools to solve tasks. It is a Docker container that provides a safe environment for XAgent to run.

ToolServer is composed of three parts:
- **ToolServerManager** is responsible for creating and managing ToolServerNode instances.
- **ToolServerMonitor** is responsible for monitoring the status of ToolServerNode instances. Automatic detection of instance status and removing instances that are not working properly.
- **ToolServerNode** is responsible for providing tools to solve tasks. It is a Docker container that provides a safe environment for XAgent to run.

Currently, ToolServer provides the following tools:
- **üìù File Editor** provide a text editing tool that can write, read, and modify files.
- **üìò Python Notebook** provides an interactive Python notebook that can run Python code to validate ideas, draw figures, etc.
- **üåè Web Browser** provides a web browser that can search and visit webpages.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Shell** provides a bash shell tool that can execute any shell commands, even install programs and host services.
- **üß© Rapid API** provides a tool to retrieve APIs from Rapid API and calling them, which provides a wide range of APIs for XAgent to use. See [ToolBench](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ToolBench) to get more information about the Rapid API collections.
You can also easily add new tools to ToolServer to enhance agent's abilities.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Configurations
Configurations for ToolServer are stored in `ToolServer/config/`. You can change them and rebuild images to apply the changes.
Notes:
- Change `node.privileged` to `false` in `manager.yml` if you don't want to use Docker in ToolServerNode. This will disable the ability to run Docker commands in ToolServerNode.
- Change `idling_close_minutes` in `monitor.yml` to change the time that ToolServerMonitor will wait before closing idle ToolServerNode instances.
- Add your API keys in `node.yml` to enable Bing search (or use backup search DuckDuckGo) and rapid API.
- Change the API timeout for Toolserver in `docker-compose.yml` by altering the values after `-t` in `services.ToolServerManager.command` if you encounter a timeout error of ToolServer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build and Setup ToolServer
All Docker image build files are stored in `ToolServer/dockerfiles`.
You can build them manually with the following command:
```bash
cd ToolServer
docker-compose build
```
This will build all the Docker images for ToolServerManager, ToolServerMonitor and ToolServerNode.

After building the Docker images, you can start the Docker container with following command:
```bash
cd ToolServer
docker-compose up
```
Note that you should install `docker` and `docker-compose` first.
